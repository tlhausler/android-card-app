# android-card-app

## Context

I needed to create a final project for a previous Java class.  I decided I would try to create an android application that would use an API to pull data (including images) for Pokemon cards.  The intended purpose was that one could use the app to search for cards and add it to a their personal collection within the app.  

## Action

I used Android Studio and watched many hours of videos on creating android apps as this wasn't covered during my academic program.  I attempted to use the pokemon card API to pull data as needed into the application.  I created two activity views, the main one which handled the search, and the second that displayed card information once you clicked a card.  Attempted to use retrofit in order to handle HTTP calls and parse json into objects in the program.  Eventually, I created a local database and gave it a sample database that had a handful of cards uploaded that could be searched.

## Result and Reflection

This project did not reach the intended functionality.  I had decided to do a project using a technology I knew nothing about, and in the time frame I was given, was not able to learn enough about to make work.  My primary learning outcome from this project was twofold: first, to be more mindful of the sorts of projects I take on in relation to my ability, especially if I know nothing about the technology; and second, to be very mindful of time restrictions when setting out to do a project, particularly with something I have no experience with.
